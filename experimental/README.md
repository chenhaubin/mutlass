# Experimental

This directory is intended for the development of "experimental" implementations. Theses kernels or functions are not well-tested and do not have stable API. Thus, they are not released as a part of the examples. We also do not recommend relying on the implementations here in formal products.

When the kernel or fucntion becomes mature, it will be moved to the example for demonstration, or integrated into MUTLASS.
